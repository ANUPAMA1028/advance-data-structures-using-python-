# Experiment 2- 2c
## Aim of the experiment- Write a program for implementing the Quick sort


### Step-by-Step procedure for the experiment

Step 1 - Consider the first element of the list as pivot (i.e., Element at first position in the list).
Step 2 - Define two variables i and j. Set i and j to first and last elements of the list respectively.
Step 3 - Increment i until list[i] > pivot then stop.
Step 4 - Decrement j until list[j] < pivot then stop.
Step 5 - If i < j then exchange list[i] and list[j].
Step 6 - Repeat steps 3,4 & 5 until i > j.
Step 7 - Exchange the pivot element with list[j] element.
